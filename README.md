1. `npm install`
2. `npm start`

## Development tooling

Dev tools were set up to be used on VS Code, but will work with other IDEs as well
([read more about setting it up here](https://blog.echobind.com/integrating-prettier-eslint-airbnb-style-guide-in-vscode-47f07b5d7d6a)).

### Code style and linting

Before pushing the code you should lint and format

* `npm run eslint:fix` will solve most simple issues with your code
* `npm run lint` will show any remaining issues in the project

#### Project structure

Folders containing a Component should be PascalCase

Otherwise default to camelCase

Reusable Components should be in the 'components/common' folder
